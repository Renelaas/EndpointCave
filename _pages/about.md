My name is Rene Laas and I work now as a Tribe Leader Security at RawWorks in the Netherlands. 

A Microsoft MVP with a deep passion for cybersecurity and Microsoft. With over 10 years of experience in IT, with a focus on security combined with Microsoft technology, I have worked for a lot of clients across industries and from small businesses to enterprise environments.

A few years ago, I started my own blog about configuring the modern workplace with Microsoft Intune and security related topics. During my journey to learn Intune and security, I found it difficult to find good content, so I decided to write my own. I get a lot of energy from helping people, which is also one of the reasons why I started my blog.

The community is very important to me. I regularly attend various community events, where I gain a lot of knowledge and make valuable connections. In 2024 I founded my own community, completely focused on data security, together with relations from the community.
